# Process Documentation for `enhanced-form.html`

This document outlines the step-by-step process that was followed to create the `enhanced-form.html` file, meeting all the requirements of the assignment.

## 1. Initial Scaffolding and Content Structure

The process began by creating a basic HTML5 document with a proper DOCTYPE declaration, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. The initial structure included:

*   **Semantic Layout:** The page was structured using semantic HTML5 elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to create a clear and accessible layout.
*   **Content Elements:** To meet the assignment requirements for content variety, the following elements were added:
    *   An ordered list (`<ol>`) to display sequential information (registration steps).
    *   A `<table>` with a `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>` to display tabular data. The `scope` attribute was used on table headers for improved accessibility.
    *   An `<audio>` element with `controls` to embed media content.

## 2. Building the HTML5 Form

The core of the assignment was the HTML5 form. The form was built with the following features:

*   **Structure and Accessibility:**
    *   A `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` were used to group related form fields.
    *   Every input field was paired with a `<label>` element, connected by the `for` and `id` attributes.
    *   ARIA attributes like `aria-required="true"` and `aria-describedby` were used to provide additional information to assistive technologies.

*   **Variety of Input Types:** The form includes a range of HTML5 input types to ensure the best possible user experience and data collection:
    *   `text`
    *   `email`
    *   `password`
    *   `date`
    *   `tel`
    *   `number`

*   **User-Friendly Attributes:** To improve usability, the following attributes were added:
    *   `placeholder`: To provide hints to the user about the expected input.
    *   `autocomplete`: To help users fill out the form faster with pre-filled data.
    *   `readonly`: To display a value that cannot be modified by the user.

## 3. Implementing HTML5 Validation

To meet the requirement of using native HTML5 validation without JavaScript, the following attributes were used:

*   `required`: To ensure that essential fields are not left empty.
*   `type="email"`: To validate the format of the email address.
*   `pattern="[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}"`: To enforce a specific format for the telephone number.
*   `min="1"` and `max="10"`: To restrict the range of values for the number input.
*   `minlength="8"`: To ensure the password meets a minimum length requirement.

## 4. Refinement and Finalization

The final step was to refine the HTML file based on user feedback:

*   **Removal of CSS:** The embedded CSS was removed from the HTML file to strictly adhere to the "HTML only" requirement. This separates the content from the presentation, which is a best practice.

This iterative process of building, validating, and refining the HTML file ensured that all the requirements of the assignment were met, resulting in a clean, accessible, and well-structured `enhanced-form.html` file.
